--------------------------------------------------------

## Task 1 --  Gauss-Legendre formula

The reports, codes and supporting documents are to be uploaded to Github at: 

[https://github.com/tiago5829/UECM3033_assign3](https://github.com/your_github_id/UECM3033_assign3)


Explain how you implement your `task1.py` here.

Explain how you get the weights and nodes used in the Gauss-Legendre quadrature.

---------------------------------------------------------

## Task 2 -- Predator-prey model

Explain how you implement your `task2.py` here, especially how to use `odeint`.


Put your graphs here and explain.

When the y0 is 0.1, y1 is 1.0.
